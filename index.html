            <h2>About Minesweeper</h2>
            <p>Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game board is divided into a grid of squares.</li>
                <li>Some squares contain mines, others are empty.</li>
                <li>The player clicks on squares to reveal them.</li>
                <li>If a square contains a mine, the game ends.</li>
                <li>If a square is empty, it shows a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.</li>
                <li>Use this information to deduce where the mines are and mark them with flags.</li>
                <li>The goal is to reveal all non-mine squares without clicking on a mine.</li>
            </ul>
